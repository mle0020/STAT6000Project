#Read in Data

First we need to read in our data set

```{r data set}
getwd()
winequality.red <- read.csv("~/GitHub/STAT6000Project/winequality-red.csv", sep=";")
winequality.red

```
Now we need to make sure there are no empty values or missing values


```{r fix data}
summary(complete.cases(winequality.red))
winequality.red <- na.omit(winequality.red)


```
Doing this check shows us that we do not have any na values in our data 
set.
Now lets do some summary statistics and box plots of the response 
value of quality
```{r data check}
summary(winequality.red)
ggplot(data=winequality.red, mapping = aes(x=quality))+
  geom_boxplot()

```
