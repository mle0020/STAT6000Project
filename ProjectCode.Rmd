## R Markdown


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
d1=read.table("student-mat.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
d2=read.table("student-por.csv",sep=";",header=TRUE,stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

d3=merge(d1,d2,by=c("school","sex","age","address","famsize","Pstatus","Medu","Fedu","Mjob","Fjob","reason","nursery","internet"))
print(nrow(d3)) # 382 students
```
